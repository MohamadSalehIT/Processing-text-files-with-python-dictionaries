# Processing-text-files-with-python-dictionaries
 We have reviews (saved as .txt files) and we want to display them on a website. To do this, we will need to write a script to convert those .txt files and process them into Python dictionaries, then upload the data onto the website.
What we will do ?  :
  -Use the Python OS module to process a directory of text files
  -Manage information stored in Python dictionaries
  -Use the Python requests module to upload content to a running Web service
  -Understand basic operations for Python requests like GET and POST methods
